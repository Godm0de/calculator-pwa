- BEMIT & SASS

### What I learned

I learn to manager serveral color themes with sass, i could implemente a prefer-color-scheme media query but i decide to use the localstorage to save the choosen theme.

I guess the magic lives in the sass theme file and this mixin:

```scss
:root{
    @include mixin.to-css-variables(colors.$dark-theme-color);
    
    &.dark-theme{
        @include mixin.to-css-variables(colors.$dark-theme-color);
    }

    &.light-theme {
        @include mixin.to-css-variables(colors.$light-theme-color);
    }
    
    &.violet-theme {
        @include mixin.to-css-variables(colors.$violet-theme-color);
    }
}
```
```scss
@mixin to-css-variables($map) {
    @each $key, $value in $map {
        --#{$key}: #{$value};
    }
}
```

I decided to use themes in another section between the generic and elements ITCSS architecture, then the last thing you need is a setting and replay this
one for any color theme that you got and then... it's ready to go!

```scss
$dark-theme-color: (
    "main-bg-color": nth($_very-dark-desaturated-blue, 1),
    "main-text-color": $_white,
    "toggle-bg-color": nth($_very-dark-desaturated-blue, 2),
    "toggle-color": $_red,
    "toggle-text-color": $_white,
    "screen-bg-color": nth($_very-dark-desaturated-blue, 3),
    "screen-text-color": $_white,
    "keypad-bg-color": nth($_desaturated-dark-blue, 3),
    "common-key-bg-color": $_light-grayish-orange,
    "common-key-shadow-color": $_grayish-orange,
    "common-key-text-color": $_very-dark-grayish-blue,
    "menu-key-bg-color": nth($_desaturated-dark-blue, 1),
    "menu-key-shadow-color": nth($_desaturated-dark-blue, 2),
    "menu-key-text-color": $_white,
    "equal-key-bg-color": $_red,
    "equal-key-shadow-color": $_dark-red,
    "equal-key-text-color": $_white,
);
```
Now the complete color scheme is fully customizable...

### Continued development

I'll keep working in multithemes because one of the things that i really wish is to made a really scalable, manageable and customizable multitheme site. Something that doesn't as easier
as it is.
